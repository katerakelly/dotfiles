# dotfiles
My work-in-progress collection of configuration files for vim, git, tmux, and whatever else comes down the pipe.

These are here mostly so I can't lose them, and also just in case they help some other lost wanderer in the landscape of tools. The grass may be always greener on the other side, but I'm pitching my tent here for now.

#### Thanks
Many thanks to Evan Shelhamer for convincing me that better tools do lead to at better time, and for open-sourcing his own dotfiles, upon which mine are largely based. His are here: https://github.com/shelhamer/dotfiles
